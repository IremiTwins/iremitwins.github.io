## Review

Replace this with your full review! Write as much or as little as you want.

### What I Loved

- The building mechanics are genuinely revolutionary
- Shrines and puzzles feel fresh despite building on BotW
- The depth system adds a whole underground world to explore

### What Could Be Better

- Performance dips in busy areas on Switch hardware
- Story is still delivered in a fragmented way

### Final Thoughts

A once-in-a-generation game that empowers the player like nothing else. Essential.
