## Review

Replace this with your full review! Write as much or as little as you want — this is your space to share your thoughts on the anime.

### What I Loved

- The Pain arc is an all-time classic
- Incredible character arcs (Itachi, Jiraiya, Kakashi)
- Some of the best fight choreography in anime

### What Could Be Better

- The filler is brutal — skip lists are your friend
- Some power scaling gets out of hand towards the end

### Final Thoughts

A cornerstone of anime that's worth the investment despite its flaws. The highs are some of the highest in the medium.
