## Review

Replace this with your full review! Write as much or as little as you want.

### What I Loved

- Massive open world that never feels empty
- Boss fights are peak FromSoftware
- Build variety is insane — sorcery, faith, bleed, str, dex, you name it

### What Could Be Better

- Some late-game bosses feel overtuned
- Co-op system could be more seamless

### Final Thoughts

A landmark title in gaming. If you enjoy action RPGs, this is essential.
