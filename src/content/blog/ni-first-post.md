## Hello World

The website is live! Glad to see it finally working in Astro. My name is Nika and my formal education is in Biochemistry and Cell Biology. I joined the Next Generation Sequencing industry where I've spent the last 8 years working. I've always been interested in technology and coding, I orignally learned Javascript in Highschool and C++ in Community College. From there though I stopped coding pretty much all together. Once I finished college and starting working I was reintroduced to code since alot of the work I did used Python. From there though I didn't do much till last year when I started learning Python. I hope to continue my journey of learning and creating - the goal being to create cool apps and eventually a game.
