## Hey Strangers

Just hopping on the train here. Excited to be working on a web-dev project with my brother and seeing where this goes. I'm just a gamer that ended up becoming simple full-stack developer who loves tackling new problems. Never thought I was the strongest developer out there but always felt like there wasn't a problem I couldn't solve. Now with the help of AI I feel like I can truly do anything. Exciting for the things to come and just happy to be here :)
